	// For example if the watcher is watching at "/foo" and the event happens at "/foo",
	// the watcher must be interested in that event.

	// 2. the watcher is a recursive watcher, it interests in the event happens after
	// its watching path. For example if watcher A watches at "/foo" and it is a recursive
	// one, it will interest in the event happens at "/foo/bar".

	// 3. when we delete a directory, we need to force notify all the watchers who watches
	// at the file we need to delete.
	// For example a watcher is watching at "/foo/bar". And we deletes "/foo". The watcher
	// should get notified even if "/foo" is not the path it is watching.
